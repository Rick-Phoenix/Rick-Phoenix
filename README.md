## Hi there 👋

My name is Rick, and I started my coding journey in 2024, after an ADHD diagnosis that has changed my life.

I started out as a Typescript developer, briefly explored the Go ecosystem and then fell in love with Rust, which has been my main language ever since.

My main focus is on creating libraries and programs that bridge ecosystem gaps and aim to improve development experience, maintainability and safety.

The projects that I've worked on include:

- [sketch](https://github.com/Rick-Phoenix/sketch), a swiss-knife templating cli that can be used to reuse various kinds of templates and structures among different projects
- [protocheck](https://github.com/Rick-Phoenix/protocheck), the first full protovalidate implementation in Rust, with full support for custom CEL-based rules and strenghtened compile-time checks for validation rules and expressions
- [protoschema](https://github.com/Rick-Phoenix/protoschema), a library that uses declarative macros to generate protobuf files programmatically, using Rust code
- [protoschema-go](https://github.com/Rick-Phoenix/protoschema-go), a library that generates protobuf files from Go code, with automatic consistency checks for sqlc database models
- [diesel-enums](https://github.com/Rick-Phoenix/diesel-enums), a library that provides seamless mappings between Rust enums and custom postgres enums or simple fixed lookup tables, with automatically generated consistency tests
- [querygen](https://github.com/Rick-Phoenix/querygen), a library that uses a simple schema to generate code for aggregated sqlite queries for sqlc
- [clipboard-watcher](https://github.com/Rick-Phoenix/clipboard-watcher), a library for monitoring the activity of the system clipboard, with customizable, performance-oriented settings
- [class-dict](https://github.com/Rick-Phoenix/class-dict), a small library to organize tailwind classes without losing your sanity

What I am currently working on:

- Refactoring protoschema to a much more comprehensive use case, that will make using protobuf in Rust feel (almost) as easy as using JSON
