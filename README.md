## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ricky, and I have been fiddling with computers all my life. 

Four months ago (September 2024), I have been diagnosed with ADHD and started treatment for it, and since then I have gone from having never written a single line of code in my life to making (humble) fullstack apps in Typescript.

Always looking to learn, discover and evolve.
